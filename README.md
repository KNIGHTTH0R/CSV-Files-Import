# CSV-Files-Import
I created an application that allows the user to import the csv files and store them into mysql. I created a database schema with a table in it to collect all the information from the files. The user can also export the files, which will land in the folder named "data." In accomplishing this project, I used as languages object oriented PHP, MYSQL, and HTML. Apache was my web server.
